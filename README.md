# BattleGame
This is an object-oriented text-based battle game using several different classes. The driver class (BattleRPG.java) is sleek
and simple, with all the heavy lifting being done in other classes. The CharacterConstructor.java class makes use of getter
and setter methods to keep everything organized and accurate based on decisions made in the CharacterSelect.java class.
The RunBattle.java class is where the decisions come together and the battle is actually executed, using calculations based
on the player's decision interacting with the NPC's (randomly) character selection.
